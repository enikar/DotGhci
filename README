This library depends on :
     - hscolour
     - pretty-show
     - ghc-paths
     - directory 

All of theses are in debian. Then, before building the library install it, else
cabal will fetch them from hackage.

Debian packages are named
       libghc-hscolour-dev
       libghc-pretty-show-dev
       libghc-ghc-paths-dev
(directory is included in ghc)

You can also install documentation packages. Just replace -dev with -doc in
debian package names.

To build :
    $ cabal v1-build
To install :
   $ cabal v1-install

A .ghci that uses this library, is included.
The .ghci requires some additional librairies to be used as is.
From debian packages :
     libghc-monad-loops-dev
     libghc-regex-tdfa-dev
     libghc-regex-tdfa-text-dev
     libghc-unordered-containers-dev 
     libghc-text-icu-dev

Not in debian:
    present

If these libraries are not present, you must comment the corresponding
import or def in .ghci. In particular, encoding is difficult to compile
I've changed the .cabal to compile with ghc-8.6.5 with debian packages.
Some constraints on version were too low on containers and regex-compat
packages for matching the debian version.     
NOTE: I removed the encoding librairie in favor of text-icu.
